## `fdasrvf`
I'm lead author of the `fdasrvf` R package ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fdasrvf/index.html); [GitHub](https://github.com/jdtuck/fdasrvf_R)). 

This package performs alignment, PCA, and modeling of multidimensional and unidimensional functions using the square-root velocity framework (Srivastava et al., 2011 [arXiv:1103.3817](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3817) and Tucker et al., 2013 [doi:10.1016/j.csda.2012.12.001](Papers/CSDA_PCA_12.pdf)). This framework allows for elastic analysis of functional data through phase and amplitude separation. Multiple papers utilize the work in this package and is listed in the [CRAN Functional Data Analysis Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/FunctionalData.html). See the package README for all the methods it implements and reference papers.

There are also version of this code for [MATLAB](https://github.com/jdtuck/fdasrvf_MATLAB), and [Julia](https://github.com/jdtuck/ElasticFDA.jl)

[Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/fdasrsf);
